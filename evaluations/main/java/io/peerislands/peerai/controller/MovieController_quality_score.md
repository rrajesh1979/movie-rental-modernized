# Quality Score: MovieController.java

## Overall Quality Score: 92/100

### Scoring Breakdown

#### Code Organization: 95/100
The `MovieController` class is well-organized with a clear separation of concerns. It follows the standard Spring MVC controller pattern, with each endpoint handling a specific REST operation.

- ✅ Clear class structure
- ✅ Logical grouping of related endpoints
- ✅ Well-named methods that reflect their purpose
- ✅ Good use of Spring annotations for mapping requests

#### Code Readability: 94/100
The code is very readable with consistent formatting and naming conventions.

- ✅ Consistent indentation and spacing
- ✅ Meaningful variable and method names
- ✅ Clean parameter naming in method signatures
- ✅ Appropriate use of whitespace

#### Documentation: 85/100
Documentation is present for all methods with JavaDoc comments, but there are some areas for improvement.

- ✅ All public methods have JavaDoc comments
- ✅ Parameters are documented
- ✅ Return values are described
- ⚠️ Could include more details about possible exceptions
- ⚠️ Missing documentation about error responses

#### Error Handling: 88/100
Basic error handling is implemented, but a more comprehensive approach would be beneficial.

- ✅ Appropriate use of HTTP status codes
- ✅ Proper null checks for data retrieval
- ⚠️ No custom exception handling
- ⚠️ Missing global exception handler

#### Testing: 70/100 (Estimated - based on test file presence)
The controller has a test file, but the scope and quality of tests cannot be fully assessed without reviewing the test content.

- ✅ Test file exists for the controller
- ⚠️ Unknown test coverage percentage
- ⚠️ Unknown test scenario completeness

#### Code Complexity: 95/100
Methods are concise and focused, with a good separation of concerns.

- ✅ Methods are short and focused on a single responsibility
- ✅ Low cyclomatic complexity
- ✅ Simple conditional logic
- ✅ Good delegation to service layer

#### Architecture: 90/100
The controller follows a standard architecture pattern but could benefit from additional architectural components.

- ✅ Clear MVC separation
- ✅ Proper dependency injection
- ✅ RESTful design principles followed
- ⚠️ Missing API versioning
- ⚠️ Missing request/response DTOs for better API contract

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Add DTOs**: Create separate DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for API requests and responses instead of directly using the domain model.

2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement a global exception handler to provide consistent error responses.

3. **Complete Documentation**: Add information about possible exceptions and error responses to JavaDoc comments.

4. **API Versioning**: Consider adding API versioning to handle future changes gracefully.

5. **Input Validation**: Add Bean Validation annotations to validate input data.

6. **Comprehensive Tests**: Ensure complete test coverage with unit and integration tests.
