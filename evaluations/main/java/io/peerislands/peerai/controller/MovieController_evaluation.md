# File Evaluation: MovieController.java

## Overall Score: 87/100

## Categories

### Code Quality: 92/100
- ✅ **Code Style** (95/100): Follows standard Java coding conventions. Well-formatted and consistently styled.
- ✅ **Complexity** (88/100): Methods have appropriate length and complexity. All controller methods are concise and focused.
- ⚠️ **Documentation** (85/100): Good JavaDoc comments for all methods, but could include more details about error handling and validation.

### Security: 83/100
- ✅ **Input Validation** (85/100): Basic validation through Spring's mechanisms, but could be more robust.
- ⚠️ **Authentication** (70/100): Missing authentication and authorization checks. No role-based access controls implemented.
- ⚠️ **Data Safety** (80/100): Proper use of ResponseEntity, but lacks explicit validation for input data.

### Performance: 85/100
- ✅ **Efficiency** (85/100): Good use of Spring's ResponseEntity for HTTP responses. No obvious performance bottlenecks.
- ✅ **Resource Usage** (90/100): Properly manages resources with dependency injection and stateless design.
- ✅ **Response Handling** (85/100): Appropriate HTTP status codes used throughout.

## Recommendations
- Add input validation using Bean Validation (`@Valid` annotation) to validate request bodies
- Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security
- Add pagination support for endpoints that return collections (like `getAllMovies()`)
- Implement request logging for audit purposes
- Consider adding versioning to the API (e.g., `/v1/api/movies`)
- Add explicit error handling with a global exception handler

## Code Issues

| Line | Severity | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|
| 54 | Warning | Missing input validation | Add `@Valid` annotation to validate the Movie object |
| 67 | Warning | Missing input validation | Add `@Valid` annotation to validate the Movie object |
| 92 | Warning | Potential injection vulnerability | Add explicit input sanitization for query parameters |
| Overall | Info | Missing authentication | Implement Spring Security to protect endpoints |
| Overall | Info | Missing pagination | Add pagination support for collection endpoints |

## Best Practices
- ✅ Follows REST API naming conventions
- ✅ Uses proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Implements dependency injection correctly
- ✅ Provides clear and descriptive endpoint mapping
- ⚠️ Missing centralized exception handling
- ⚠️ API versioning should be implemented
- ⚠️ Missing request/response logging
