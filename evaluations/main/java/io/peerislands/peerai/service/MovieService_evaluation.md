# File Evaluation: MovieService.java

## Overall Score: 83/100

## Categories

### Code Quality: 85/100
- ✅ **Code Style** (90/100): Follows standard Java coding conventions with good formatting and style.
- ✅ **Complexity** (85/100): Methods have appropriate complexity with straightforward logic.
- ⚠️ **Documentation** (80/100): Good JavaDoc comments but some methods could benefit from more detailed documentation.

### Security: 75/100
- ⚠️ **Input Validation** (70/100): Minimal input validation, particularly in the searchMovies method.
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** (70/100): Minimal error handling, returning null instead of throwing appropriate exceptions.
- ⚠️ **Data Safety** (80/100): No explicit input sanitization for search parameters.

### Performance: 80/100
- ✅ **Efficiency** (80/100): Operations are generally efficient.
- ⚠️ **Database Access** (75/100): Direct use of MongoTemplate in searchMovies method without proper pagination.
- ⚠️ **Memory Management** (85/100): Good memory management but could improve for large collections.

## Recommendations
- Replace null returns with appropriate exceptions (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException`)
- Add input validation for search parameters
- Implement pagination for methods returning collections
- Enhance error handling with more specific exception types
- Add transaction management where appropriate
- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed movies
- Improve MongoTemplate usage with proper error handling and optimization

## Code Issues

| Line | Severity | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|
| 36 | Warning | Returns null instead of exception | Throw a `ResourceNotFoundException` instead of returning null |
| 58 | Warning | Returns null instead of exception | Throw a `ResourceNotFoundException` instead of returning null |
| 76 | Info | No transaction management | Consider adding `@Transactional` annotation |
| 92-104 | Warning | Potential query injection | Add explicit input sanitization for query parameters |
| 105 | Warning | Missing pagination | Implement pagination for search results |
| Overall | Info | Missing exception handling | Add try/catch blocks with appropriate exception handling |

## Best Practices
- ✅ Follows single responsibility principle
- ✅ Uses dependency injection correctly
- ✅ Provides clean service interfaces
- ⚠️ Missing proper exception handling
- ⚠️ Missing transaction management
- ⚠️ Missing pagination support
- ⚠️ Inconsistent query approach (using both repository methods and MongoTemplate)
