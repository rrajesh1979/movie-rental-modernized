# File Evaluation: MovieRepository.java

## Overall Score: 85/100

## Categories

### Code Quality: 90/100
- ✅ **Code Style** (95/100): Clean, concise interface with appropriate Spring Data MongoDB annotations.
- ✅ **Complexity** (95/100): Simple and straightforward repository interface.
- ✅ **Documentation** (80/100): Documentation exists but could be more detailed for query methods.

### Design: 85/100
- ✅ **Interface Definition** (90/100): Properly extends MongoRepository with correct entity and ID types.
- ✅ **Method Naming** (90/100): Uses Spring Data naming conventions for the findByTitle method.
- ⚠️ **Method Coverage** (75/100): Only includes one custom query method; could benefit from additional query methods.

### Performance: 80/100
- ✅ **Query Definition** (85/100): The findByTitle method follows Spring Data conventions.
- ⚠️ **Index Support** (70/100): No explicit index definitions for queried fields.
- ⚠️ **Pagination Support** (75/100): No explicit pagination methods defined.

## Recommendations
- Add more custom query methods for common search patterns
- Add index annotations to improve query performance (e.g., @Indexed on the title field)
- Include pagination variants for methods that could return large result sets
- Add more specific documentation with examples for query methods
- Consider adding query methods that use MongoDB aggregation features
- Add derived query methods for other fields like rating, releaseYear, etc.

## Code Issues

| Line | Severity | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|
| 8 | Info | No index defined on title field | Add `@Indexed` to the title field in the Movie entity |
| Overall | Info | Limited query methods | Add more query methods for common search patterns |
| Overall | Info | Missing pagination support | Add methods with Pageable parameters |

## Best Practices
- ✅ Follows Spring Data repository pattern
- ✅ Uses appropriate naming conventions for query methods
- ✅ Includes documentation for the custom method
- ⚠️ Missing index annotations in the entity class
- ⚠️ Limited query method coverage
- ⚠️ No pagination support for methods that could return large result sets

```java

     * @param rating the rating to search for
     * @return a list of movies with the specified rating

     * Finds movies released in a specific year.

     * Finds movies containing the given text in their title, with pagination support.
     *
     * @param titleContains text to search for in the title

     * @return a page of movies matching the title search
     */
    Page<Movie> findByTitleContainingIgnoreCase(String titleContains, Pageable pageable);
    
    /**
     * Finds movies by category.
     *
     * @param categoryName the category name to search for
